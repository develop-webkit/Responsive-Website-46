						<p class="mb-0 mt-4"><strong>†Pre-Qualified Credit Offer:</strong></p>
						<p>You received this offer because you meet lender’s initial credit
							worthiness
							criteria. If your application information differs from the information used during your
							pre-qualification or if you are unable to meet lender’s full credit eligibility criteria,
							your
							application may not be approved. We did not know your income during the pre-qualification
							process, so it
							was not considered when determining pre-qualification status. You will be asked to provide
							your income
							when you apply and if it does not meet our minimum requirements, your application may not be
							approved.
							We also did not know your housing expenses, which will be considered during the application
							process and
							may impact your approval. This letter is not a loan approval, nor is it a guarantee that you
							will
							receive a loan through LendingUSA. In order to receive a final loan approval, you must
							enroll in a
							participating program and pay the Down Payment*; submit a formal application; and pass our
							final
							underwriting review, which is inclusive of: (a) your continuing to meet criteria for this
							prescreened
							offer; (b) your credit report, application and credit history meeting our pre-established
							credit
							criteria, including maintaining a minimum 500 FICO score; (c) your monthly debt-to-income
							ratio (i.e.,
							total monthly debt payments including rent an mortgage divided by monthly gross income) not
							exceeding
							70%; and (d) verification of your identity, income and/or employment. An origination fee of
							up to 8% may
							be included in the principal loan amount that may result in an APR of up to 29.99%. Amounts
							financed
							range from $1,000 to $35,000 but varies by state. Loans are not available in all states.
							Loan proceeds
							shall only be used to pay off and consolidate the accounts that you enrolled in the
							participating
							program and must be repaid.</p>
						<p class="mb-0 mt-4"><strong>*Participating Program Overview:</strong></p>
						<p>Upon contacting LendingUSA, you will be referred to a participating
							program provider
							(“PPP”) that offers a participating program. LendingUSA may receive compensation from the
							PPP related to
							this referral. By enrolling in a participating program, the PPP will create a payment plan
							for you and
							set up a customer dedicated account for you to make those payments to, so that they can be
							escrowed. You
							will then be asked to stop paying on your enrolled accounts. The PPP will then attempt to
							negotiate your
							enrolled accounts down to less than what you currently owe and use those escrowed payments
							to pay off
							your creditors over time for a fee. Enrolling and participating in a participating program
							may have
							adverse credit, tax, and legal consequences. To be eligible to apply for a Freshstart loan,
							you must
							enroll in a PPP program and deposit a specified percentage of your combined enrolled account
							total into
							your customer dedicated account as a down payment (“Down Payment”).</p>
